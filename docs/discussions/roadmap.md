# Roadmap

Future goals include:

- [ ] Add support for network isolation with bubblewrap.
- [ ] Use notify-send when starting from a .desktop file.
- [ ] Support sub-command `run`, `image`, `ps`, `inspect`, ... (and makes the `run` the default implicit).
- [ ] Better documentation and integration tests.
- [ ] Manage environment dependencies, for example to auto-start a vpn needed by a browser.
- [ ] Integrate [udica](https://github.com/containers/udica) to setup SELinux policy.
- [ ] Support `kubernetes` runtime.
- [ ] Support `docker-compose` runtime.
