# Roadmap

Future goals include:

* Automatic squash of old layers: (depends on https://github.com/containers/buildah/issues/1778).
* Better documentation and integration tests.
* Cleanup runDir.
* Manage environment dependencies, for example to auto-start a vpn needed by a browser.
* Integrate [udica](https://github.com/containers/udica) to setup SELinux policy.
